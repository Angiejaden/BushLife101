            <p style="float: right;">Psalm 91:5-7 <br>
                You will not fear the terror of night nor the arrow that flies by day nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness,nor the plague that destroys at midday.
                A thousand may fall at your side ten thousand at your right hand but it will not come near you.<br>
                
                There will always be drama,sicknesses and pain as long as the world is revolving,but you will find peace once you know that God is always in control and He never abandons His people as clearly stated aboveðŸ‘†ðŸ‘†ðŸ˜Š.<br>
                
                So when our fears overwhelm us, may we remember that He holds our future, that He had gone ahead of us and there is no place He can't be found. May this period be a reflection of faith anchored in God and may He help us hold unwaveringly to His unchanging hand.âœ¨<br>
