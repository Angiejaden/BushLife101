            The mind is a powerful weapon. I say weapon because it can be used for self-defence and offer security or it can be twisted to form a perilous tool. What we feed and tell our minds manifests itself not only in our daily lives but also in our inner beings. Sometimes we set ablaze the dying embers of our dreams, conscience and visions or try to salvage the ashes of broken aspirations, souls and joys. You will once in a minute see a happy person who hides blood shot tears and a disfigured frown. <br/>
            There is always a crack no matter how happy or perfect you may think you are. I believe joy cannot be sourced from outside without breeding it within. When you are renewed and no longer have to conform to the unspoken rules of joy, then you have just opened that rustic gate that just didn’t seem to budge. If you keep comparing your source of joy to others, then you are just a jammed photocopy machine. A lot of people don’t think that they have to deal with their mental health because society has painted a pretty grim picture of mentally affected persons. You are mad, possessed or cursed. Yet all you are is broken, hopeless and defeated. <br/>
            You are weird, awkward and unwanted. Yet all you are is tired, weary and sore. You are ugly, hostile and incapacitated. Yet all you are is scarred, pained and abused. You are irrational, impulsive and repulsive. Yet all you are is scared, tortured and bullied. Seeking understanding in the judgemental and fixated society is just playing the guitar to a homeless man. Useless! I would be lying if I said I don’t write this in tears. This time not on my own my own account. This is for how diminutive and primitive the society has become. Suicide was once considered an SOS, the last resort or an end to a damaged soul. <br/>
            Now it’s an act of cowardice, weakness and even enough to make tweets, headlines, likes, posts, chats and reposts. There was a silent permeating, combative and slowly decaying call but people just fail to read in between the lines. Just because one is not aware of their mental health status does not give them the privileged and often misused right to declare themselves 1000% human and lord over the affected. One cannot change society but society sure can change one. Asking someone why they are depressed and life is so beautiful is like asking someone why they have asthma yet there is so much air. I hope one-day society will shift its mind-set and believe in healing rather than in rebuking. Dear one if you ever feel like you’re fighting battles remember you’re notalone. The society needs to wake up. 
            Depression is not special. Anxiety is not cute. Self-harm scars are not beautiful. Suicide is not poetic. Eating disorders are not glamorous. Schizophrenia is terrifying. Don’t pretend to have hallucinations. You won’t want them. Mental illnesses are not romantic so stop treating them that way.<br/>
            Until the lion learns how to write, every story will glorify the hunter. So speak because your voice is the only weapon they can’t take from you.<br/>
