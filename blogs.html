    <p>Raindrops
        The drops splatter across the floor.
        Maybe with close attention you can hear the rhythm
        The consistent splash have created s,all depressions
        On the mound of Earth. 
        
        Rain is beautiful
        The way the color of the ground changes, is amazing…
        And the drops left on the leaf surfaces to reflect light of the sun
        When the rain has passed
        
        Different people have different interpretations
        And Once
        … I imagined the raindrops to be small happy moments we have
        Everyday
        They are beautiful
        And when consistent they leave an impact
        And they leave happy memories to reflect upon when it’s gone.

    <p>The forbidden tree;
        My forbidden tree,
        your fruits, oh, so
        beautiful,
        tempting and attractive,
        calling me into your cage.
        
        I so solemnly want to
        take a bite and
        taste what you have
        that has me drooling.
        
        But I avoid you,
        keeping my distance from you,
        knowing that at the first bite-
        at that first bite-
        I will want more than you have;
        more than you could give.
        
        So as beautiful as you are,
        I leave you be,
        keeping safe distance away
        as I am the tempted Eve.
        
        So I’ll stay in my own cage,
        with my ugly heart,
        my ugly scars and desires,
        my rotten thoughts and behaviours,
        to keep you, oh Forbidden,
        safe and sound.

        Does anybody see
        the tears in her eyes,
        the pain that she hides,
        or do you just see, the smiles she
        uses as a disguise?

        Does anybody hear
        the fear in her voice,
        the shriek in her scream,
        or is it just, the joy in her tone?

        Does anybody feel
        the weak beats
        her fragile heart makes,
        the slow blood flow in her veins,
        or is it, just a good hug?

        Does anybody overlook
        the stories she tells,
        the joy she brings,
        or do you just, look at her smiles?

        She cries herself to sleep, everyday.
        The shriek in her voice,
        no one can tell.
        But she won’t let you know;
        she does not want to.

        The pain she feels
        she just cannot tell,
        and so, she chooses to pretend.
        Who would know anyway?

        Happy;
        that is how you ought to be,
        and is what you seem to be.
        
        Stressed out;
        that is all that came out
        from my presence and absence;
        from our coming in and out.
        
        I do not know if you really
        need me,
        or if you’re trying to play me.
        
        But I hope you’re as happy
        as you ought to be,
        and if you’ll ever need me
        or want me,
        you know where to find me.
